## Acknowledgements: 
## - Course Staff in helping understand meaning behind assignment specifications, and potential pitfalls to look out for.
## - My partner and I did a lot of research on how we could implement our ideas in our design, this allowed us to abstract the problem a lot more quickly, and break it down.
## - While pair programming, we learned a lot from each other in how we could break down a problem, or easier ways to solve a problem.

## Implementation:
## - We implemented our library pretty well, and follows our design document pretty closely. In particular, I felt that we were able to take a 1D array and turn it into our desired representation of a 2D array pretty well.
## - One thing that we probably didn't do the greatest on, was testing for performance. While with Rust, it's safe the say that the code runs pretty fast, we aren't 100% sure if our program is performing as efficiently as possible.

## Design Checklist:
## -
